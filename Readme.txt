Goal. Automate daily data retrieval from meteomatics

Meteomatics.IPYNB 
 Code with the parameters, time frame, and locations to retrieve data
 Save dataframe in a csv file 

Meteomatics.csv 
 Saved dataframe
 Problem. The dataframe doesn't save lat lon or dates. 


TO DO. Write a flask app to automate data retrieval on a daily basis

-So far, I have created the flask app that displays only the last data, and it also displays the real time. I commited procfile, requirements, app.py, templates.

To do: Find a way to put the data running automatically and send directly to mlab. 
Finish the css part.
